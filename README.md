## Dataset
> TODO 

### Tabular Data

The **tabular data** files are located in `dataset` folder. The folder `dataset/daily` holds the daily updates in each country.

<!-- > The metadata for the tabular data is found in `.dataherb/metadata.yml`. -->
> TODO 

<!-- ### Other Data

Some of the countries publish more than simple tabular data. We cache the files in `documents` folder. -->

### Scrapers

The scripts that are being used to update the data are located in `scripts` folder. Most of the scripts require the `utils.py` module to run. Create a new environment and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements.

<!-- The workflows that update the dataset are defined in `.github/workflows`. The python scripts are scheduled to run on GitHub Actions. -->
